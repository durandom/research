## Explanation
- Multiple client types (web and mobile)
- API Gateway pattern with load balancing
- Four microservices: User, Product, Order, Payment
- Each service has its own database (database per service pattern)
- Message queue for asynchronous communication
- Redis cache for performance optimization
